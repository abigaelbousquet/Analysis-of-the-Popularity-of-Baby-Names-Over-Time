# Analysis-of-the-Popularity-of-Baby-Names-Over-Time

This program will use a CSV data file with data from Google BigQuery, pandas, and matplotlib to allow a user to learn about the change in popularity of different names over time, between 1960 and 2009.

This is my favorite CS project of what I've done so far because of its application to real-world data!
